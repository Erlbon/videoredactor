"""
release_notes.py

Builds a GitHub Release's notes from CHANGELOG.md: every version
section AFTER the previous published release, up to and including the
version being released -- not just the newest section. Used by
.github/workflows/release.yml.

Before 2026-09-28 the workflow took only the tagged version's own
section, so a release after several unreleased check-ins described
only the last one (v2026-09-28-04 listed #04 but not 09-23#02 or
09-28#01-#03).

Versions look like "2026-09-28#05" in CHANGELOG.md headings
("## 2026-09-28#05 -- title") and "v2026-09-28-05" as tags.

Usage (from the workflow):
    python release_notes.py <tag> <published release tags, one per line, in a file> <output .md>
