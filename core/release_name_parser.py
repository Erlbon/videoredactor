"""
core/release_name_parser.py

Turns a scene/release-style video filename stem into a search-friendly
guess: a clean title (junk tags stripped) plus, when present, a year
(movies) or season/episode number(s) (TV) -- so TMDB/TheTVDB search
gets "Inception" instead of "Inception 2010 1080p BluRay x264-GROUP",
and the episode picker can be pre-selected on the right season/episode
instead of hunting through a season's episode list by hand every time.

This is deliberately a purpose-built heuristic parser, not a full
release-name grammar (no dependency on guessit/rebulk) -- consistent
with this project's "shell out to real tools, otherwise write it
ourselves" approach, and keeps the PyInstaller build dependency-light.
It only needs to get CLOSE: the result feeds a search box the user can
still edit, and season/episode selections the user still explicitly
confirms in the picker dialogs -- never applied without confirmation,
same principle as everywhere else TMDB/TVDB data lands in this app.
